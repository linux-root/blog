## About Me

Hi! I'm Watson, a Scala Software Engineer with a passion for functional programming and clean code principles.
I believe in writing code that's not just functional, but also beautiful and maintainable.

When I'm not coding, you can find me on the basketball court or exploring new technologies.
I'm particularly passionate about the Scala ecosystem and its powerful functional programming capabilities.

- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

## Tech Stack

My primary expertise includes:

- **Languages:** Scala (main), Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python
- **Frameworks:** ZIO, Cats, Cats-Effect, FS2, Tapir, Akka, Pekko, Play Framework
- **Frontend:** Laminar, Tyrian, Vue.js, React
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Couchbase, DB2

## Sample Code

### Hello World in Scala

```scala

import cats.effect.IO

object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): IO[Unit] = {
    for {
      _ <- IO.println("Hello, World!")
      _ <- IO.println("Welcome to my Scala blog!")
    } yield ()
  }
}
```
